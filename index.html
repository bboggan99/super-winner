        <section>
            <h3>Places Lived</h3>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>Be it outdoors, media, people, or philosophy, I have a lot of interests. I recently got a plant and have a replica of General Washington's flag he flew during the Revolutionary War. I think Porsche 911 Spyders are beautiful. Princess Diana looked like a queen—fitting. Art and beauty run the world, and I am here for it. I also value reliability; I have had three Toyota-made automobiles—I crashed two of them. I am the problem, not them.</p>

            <h3>Views</h3>
            <p>Family is important. You are important. What you do for yourself helps others too. Follow your path, work hard, and God will bless you—and not just because you sneezed.</p>
